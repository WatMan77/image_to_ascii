# image_to_ascii
A very simple image to ascii art converter using SFML.
As of now, the only way to run the program is through VS 2019 on Windows (as far as my knowledge goes).
Start the program and give the path to your image (preferably .png) using backlashes \.
If you do not know any path, type \0 instead.
The text will be saved in a file called "ascii.txt".

A very short but project mainly for the purpose of learning a bit about images, C++ and SFML.
Have fun!
